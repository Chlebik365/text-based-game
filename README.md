# Project Green

Project of me and my friends originally started a year ago by me when I started coding, then forgotten. And in the last month I've returned to it, made the code for the engine twice as long, finally made a basic script of the game and built a four-person team around it consisting of my friends/classmates.

The game is meant to be played by my classmates, but doesn't use any inside jokes so it will be fun even for normal people
